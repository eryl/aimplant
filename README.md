# Masked Language Modeling for the Federated Health project

This repository contain code to train an XLMRoberta model using masked language modelling and LoRA fine tuning. The code is based on the [NLP-NER](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/tree/main/examples/advanced/nlp-ner) example, incorporating code from the Huggingface [run_mlm.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling/run_mlm_no_trainer.py) scripts.

As example datasets, the code uses works of Jane Austen and Shakespeare.
